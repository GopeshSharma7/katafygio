# To only include objects matching a kubernetes selector:
#filter: "vendor=foo,app=bar"

# Example exclusions by object kind. E.g.: keep secrets confidential,
# don't dump pods or replicaset  they are all managed by deployments
# or daemonsets (which are already dumped), endpoints (managed by services,
# already dumped), and noisy stuff (events, nodes...).
#exclude-kind:
#  - secrets
#  - pods
#  - replicasets
#  - nodes
#  - events
#  - endpoints

# Example exclusion for specific objects:
#exclude-object:
#  - configmap:kube-system/datadog-leader-elector
#  - deployment:default/testdeploy

# Exclude objects (like pods, replicasets) generated/managed by other
# objects we already archive:
#exclude-having-owner-ref: true

# Exclude namespaces matching some regular expressions:
# exclude-namespaces:
#  - jenkins.*
#  - temp-.*

# Only dump objects belonging to a specific namespace
#namespace:

# Set to true to dump once and exit (instead of continuously dumping new changes)
dump-only: false

# Set to true to disable git versionning
no-git: false

# Set to true to simulate operations (not dumping or versionning anything)
dry-run: false
